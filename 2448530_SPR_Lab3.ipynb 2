        "\n",
        "1) How accurately did each method recognize speech?\n",
        "   - Whisper: Very high accuracy. Output was: \"I believe you're just talking nonsense.\"\n",
        "     Whisper produced correct grammar and punctuation.\n",
        "   - Vosk: High accuracy. Output was: \"i believe you're just talking nonsense\"\n",
        "     Accurate words but lacked capitalization and punctuation.\n",
        "   - Google API: Very high accuracy. Output was: \"I believe you are just talking nonsense\"\n",
        "     Similar meaning, only expanded the contraction ('you're' → 'you are').\n",
        "\n",
        "2) How well did the system handle errors?\n",
        "   - The system showed clear feedback messages at each stage: 'Speak something...', 'Recognizing...',\n",
        "     and 'Speech successfully converted to text!'.\n",
        "   - Missing package/model errors were handled gracefully earlier with proper warnings.\n",
        "   - No crashes occurred during recognition. Overall error handling was excellent.\n",
        "\n",
        "3) Which method performed best per scenario?\n",
        "   - Clear male/female voice: Whisper / Google performed the best.\n",
        "   - Soft voice: Whisper performed better due to strong robustness.\n",
        "   - Fast speech: Google performed better for fluent and quick speech.\n",
        "   - Noisy background: Whisper performed best due to noise-resistant training.\n",
        "   - Offline mode: Whisper and Vosk work without internet.\n",
        "   - Suggestions for improvements: Add noise reduction, use larger Whisper models, add punctuation\n",
        "     correction for Vosk, integrate command execution in future versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4) Deliverables:\n",
        "   - Screenshots of console output.\n",
        "   - Generated CSV file: speech_comparison.csv.\n",
        "   - Sample audio file used.\n",
        "   - Final code and this inference section.\n",
